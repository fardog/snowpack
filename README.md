Intro
-----

**snowpack** is (someday) a complete GUI client and backup solution for  
Amazon Glacier. Currently, it is a very early test while I bring my C# skills  
back up to current. Please don't use it until then, you will be disappointed.

Status
------

Right now, snowpack can store any file to Glacier, and stores the ID of any  
archived file to an SQLite DB for later retrieval. It stores full directory  
structure, and will include a tree browser for requesting restores. There is
a basic de-duplication process in place, where file checksums and sizes are
stored, and a file is considered to be a duplicate if those two items match
a previously stored file. The file's location and other info are still stored
in the database as though it was uploaded.

Now that I feel like this is a successful test, the current areas of work are:

 - Creating an upload queue
 - Separating upload code from interface code
 - Adding support for recursive uploads (such as adding a whole directory)
 - Adding a backup archive browser, and the ability to make file requests

The future will be:

 - Moving things to a client/server architecture with a background daemon that
   performs uploads and reads a queue and a client that manages that queue and
   checks progress.
 - Performing automated restores of some kind
 

Misc
----

This requires an App.config file with the following properties in the  
*appSettings* section:

 -	*AWSAccessKey*
 -	*AWSSecretKey*
 -	*AWSRegion* (e.g. "us-west-2", "us-east-1", etc.)
