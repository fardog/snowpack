Intro
-----

**snowpack** is (someday) a complete GUI client and backup solution for
Amazon Glacier. Right now it's a heavy work-in-progress, but is more capable
all the time.

**snowpack is incomplete, and not recommended for anyone's use at the moment.**
While you'll be able to store files to Glacier, and view _what_ you've stored,
there is no method for retrieving files (or performing a test restore) yet.

Status
------

Right now, snowpack can store any file to Glacier, and stores the ID of any
archived file to an SQLite DB for later retrieval. There is a basic de-
duplication process in place, where file checksums and sizes are stored, and a
file is considered to be a duplicate if those two items match a previously 
stored file. The file's location and other info are still stored in the 
database as though it was uploaded.

Current areas of work are:

 - File restores and deletions from Glacier
 - Log viewer for tracking any upload failures.
 - More thorough upload queue management, save on quit

The future will be:

 - Moving things to a client/server architecture with a background daemon that
   performs uploads and reads a queue and a client that manages that queue and
   checks progress.
 - Create backups of file index/SQLite database to Glacier
 - Retrieving vault list from AWS
 - Resuming restore jobs if the application is quit
 

Misc
----

snowpack requires AWS credentials and a Glacier vault, and will ask for them
on first run. You can create the necessary credentials and vault using your
AWS console. I'd recommend reading the 
[Getting Started](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) guide for Glacier prior to
trying out snowpack.
