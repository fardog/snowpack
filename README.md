Intro
-----

**snowpack** is (someday) a complete GUI client and backup solution for  
Amazon Glacier. Currently, it is a very early test while I bring my C# skills  
back up to current. Please don't use it until then, you will be disappointed.

Right now, snowpack can store any file to Glacier, and stores the ID of any  
archived file to an SQLite DB for later retrieval. It stores full directory  
structure, and will include a tree browser for requesting restores.

Misc
----

This requires an App.config file with the following properties in the  
*appSettings* section:

 -	*AWSAccessKey*
 -	*AWSSecretKey*
 -	*AWSRegion* (e.g. "us-west-2", "us-east-1", etc.)
 -	*GlacierVaultName*
